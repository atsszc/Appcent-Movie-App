        Hello, my name is Ahmed Turan Sözcü. This project was made for a case
        study sent by Appcent company. The project is a movie site. The movie
        site was made using Next.js. Tailwind CSS was used on the design side.
        Different features were added for the case other than what was expected.
        These features are swipper, dark-light mode switch, search, top rated
        and trending categories.
      </p>

      <p className="flex text-2xl justify-center mt-32">
      ⭐⭐⭐ I would like to thank Appcent for this project. ⭐⭐⭐
      </p>
    </div>
